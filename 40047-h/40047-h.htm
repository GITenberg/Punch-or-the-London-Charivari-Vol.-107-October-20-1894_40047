<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="indent">The Assistant-Reader has been at work, and makes the following
report:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:50%;">
<a href="images/181.png"><img width="100%" src="images/181.png" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p class="indent">A pretty little volume is Mr. <span class="smcap">Anthony C. Deane&#39;s</span> <i>Holiday
Rhymes</i> (<span class="smcap">Henry &amp; Co</span>). That its merits are high may be safely
inferred from the fact that the largest instalment of its verses came
from the columns of <i>Mr. Punch</i>. Mr. <span class="smcap">Deane</span> handles his varied
metres with great skill, his style is neat and pointed, his rhymes are
above reproach, and his satire, especially when he deals with
literary and academic matters, hits hard and straight. And, though
the author is a Deane, he never sermonises. But why not sermons
in verse? I commend the idea to Mr. <span class="smcap">Deane</span>. He could carry it
out excellently, and earn the thanks of countless congregations.</p>

<p class="indent">Messrs. <span class="smcap">Methuen</span> are publishing a series of English Classics,
edited by Mr. <span class="smcap">W. E. Henley</span>. They have started with <i>Tristram
Shandy</i>, and have persuaded a Mr. <span class="smcap">Charles Whibley</span> to introduce
<span class="smcap">Laurence Sterne</span> to the reading public of the present day.
&quot;Permit me,&quot; says Mr. <span class="smcap">Whibley</span>, in effect, &quot;to present to your
notice <span class="smcap">Laurence Sterne</span>, plagiarist, sentimentalist, and dealer in
the obscene,&quot; a right pleasant and comfortable introduction, setting
us all at our ease, and predisposing us at once in favour of
the humble candidate for fame, whom Mr. <span class="smcap">Whibley</span> alternately
kicks and patronises. &#39;Tis pity (I have caught Mr. <span class="smcap">Whibley&#39;s</span>
own trick) that Mr. <span class="smcap">Whibley</span> had not the writing of
<i>Tristram Shandy</i>. He, at any rate&mdash;so he seems to think&mdash;would
never have outraged our sense of decency, or moved us
to &quot;thrills of æsthetic disgust&quot; by such platitudes as <i>My Uncle
Toby&#39;s</i> address to the fly. <span class="smcap">Rabelais</span>, it appears (Mr. <span class="smcap">Whibley</span> has
got <span class="smcap">Rabelais</span> on the brain, he is Pantagruelocephalous), <span class="smcap">Rabelais</span>
may steal a horse, but <span class="smcap">Sterne</span> must not look over a hedge. One
may have no wish to defend the &quot;indecencies&quot; of <span class="smcap">Sterne</span>, but to
condemn them by contrasting them with the efforts of <span class="smcap">Rabelais</span>
is a highly modernised form of criticism, of which I should scarcely
have supposed even a <span class="smcap">Whibley</span> capable. On the whole, I cannot
commend this introduction, with its jingling, tin-pot, sham-fantastic
style. I feel inclined to cry out aloud with Master <i>Peter</i>, &quot;Plainness,
good boy; do not you soar so high; this affectation is scurvy.&quot;
And why is Mr. <span class="smcap">Whibley</span> so hard upon the suburbs? His own
manner of writing is excellently calculated to fascinate Clapham,
and move Peckham Rye to an enthusiasm of admiration.</p>

<p class="indent">Messrs. <span class="smcap">Chatto and Windus</span> have brought to a happy conclusion
their monumental work of republishing the <span class="smcap">Campbell and Stebbing</span>
translation of <i>Thiers&#39; History of the Consulate and Empire</i>. It is in
twelve neatly bound, conveniently sized, admirably printed volumes,
illustrated with many steel engravings. A little soon, perhaps, to talk
of Christmas presents. But if there be any amiable uncle or fairy godmother
kept awake o&#39; nights wondering what they shall give for
Christmas box to Dick, Tom or Harry, here&#39;s the very thing for him,
her and them. The volumes comprise a library in themselves, and
their study is a liberal education. Since the world began there is no
human life that possesses for humanity an interest keener or more
abiding than that of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>. Sometimes for a while it seems to
sleep, only to awaken with freshened vigour. The <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> cult is
one of the most prominent features of to-day. The Presses of Paris,
London and New York teem with new volumes of reminiscences,
letters or diaries, all about <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>. <span class="smcap">Thiers&#39;</span> massive work has
stood the test of time and will ever remain a classic. To us who read
it to-day it has the added interest of its author&#39;s personality, and the
sad labour of his closing years. It is pretty to note how <span class="smcap">Thiers</span>,
writing before the creation of the Third Empire, for which this book
did much to pave the way, shrinks from mentioning Waterloo. For
him it is &quot;the battle after the day of Ligny and Quatre Bras.&quot; We
are well into his detailed account of the great fight before we recognise
the plains of Waterloo. <span class="smcap">Thiers</span> does not disguise his effort
to extol the Prussians at the expense of the English. It was <span class="smcap">Blucher</span>,
not <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, who won the fight the Prussians call the Battle of
La Belle Alliance, <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> the Battle of Mont St. Jean, and
the presumptuous English Waterloo. The patriotic and therefore
irascible Frenchman little thought the day would dawn on France
when it would learn of a battle more calamitous even than Waterloo.
Still less did he perpend that he himself would make the personal
acquaintance of the Prussians in circumstances analagous to those
amid which, on a July day in 1815, three plenipotentiaries set forth
from Paris to meet the foreign invaders, and sue for terms that
should, as far as possible, lessen the humiliation of the occupation
of the French capital.</p>

<p class="indent">I confess I am disappointed with <span class="smcap">Anthony Hope&#39;s</span> <i>The God in the
Car</i>. Some of the dialogue is in his very best &quot;Dolly&quot; comedy-vein.
The last interview between hero and heroine is admirably written.
But it is not &quot;in it&quot; with his most originally conceived story of
<i>The Prisoner of Zenda</i>. The title requires explanation, and you
don&#39;t get the explanation until the climax, which explanation is
as unsatisfactory as the title. &quot;The hazy finish is,&quot; quoth the
Baron, &quot;to my thinking, artistic.&quot; &quot;What becomes of the lady?
what becomes of the lover?&quot; are questions the regular romance-reader
will put. And the reply is evidently the old one, on which
no improvement is possible, &quot;Whatever you please my little dear,
you pays your money and you takes your choice.&quot; But it is well
worth reading, and our friend &quot;the Skipper,&quot; who &quot;knows the
ropes,&quot; will find there are some, though not very frequent, opportunities
for his mental gymnastic exercise.</p>

<h2>A CLERICAL QUESTION
FOR EXETER.</h2>

<p class="indent">The Special Correspondent
&quot;doing&quot; the Church Congress
at Exeter for the <i>Morning Post</i>,
when remarking on the clerical
costumes in the procession to the
Cathedral, told us that among
the &quot;college caps&quot; <i>i.e.</i> &quot;mortar-boards,&quot;
(which of course
go with the university gown
or clerical surplice,) and
&quot;birettas,&quot; (which, being
Italian, are not certainly part
of English academical or
ecclesiastical costume,) there
appeared a &quot;tall hat,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>
the topper of private life,
which, as it happens, is part
of the Academical Master
of Arts costume, and therefore,
though unbecoming in a
procession of mortar-boards
and birettas, is yet unassailable
from a purely academic
and Cantabrigian point of view.
It may not be &quot;Oxonian,&quot; by
the way; but if the wearer
were an Oxford man he would
know best. Now, if the hat, presumably
black, had been <i>a white
one</i>? White is the surplice:
why not the hat? White is the
emblem of purity, although,
sad to say, when associated
with a hat, it used at one time
to be provocative of an inquiry
as to the honesty of the wearer
in regard to the surreptitious
possesion of a donkey. Has
anybody anywhere ever seen
a parson, whether M.A. or
not, in a white hat? Surely
such a phenomenon must rank
with the defunct postboy and
dead donkey. This will be
one of the inquiries to which
clerical costume at ecclesiastical
Exeter must naturally give
rise. Perhaps the top-hatted
clergyman was a Freemason,
wearing this as emblematic of
a &quot;tiled lodge.&quot;</p>

<h2>&quot;ALL UP WITH THE
EMPIRE!&quot;</h2>

<p class="indent">This is a dreadful cry to
raise. Let&#39;s hope it is not
anywhere near the truth.
Says the Emperor, <i>i.e.</i> the
chairman of the Empire
(Theatre), &quot;There will be only
one effect should the County
Council endorse the decision
of its Licensing Committee.
The Empire Theatre will be at
once closed, as it would be impossible
to carry it on under
such absurd restrictions.&quot;
Such is the Imperial ukase
issuing from Leicester Square.
And the Emperor is right.
This &quot;grandmotherly legislation,&quot;
however well-intentioned
the grandmothers, may
be all very well for &quot;babes
and sucklings,&quot; but then
babies in arms are not admitted
to the Empire, and
those babes of older growth
who have evidently been partaking
too freely of &quot;the
bottle&quot; are strictly excluded
by the I. C. O. or Imperial
Chuckers Out. No doubt
London common sense will
ultimately prevail, even in the
Court of the London County
Council, and the Empire will
soon be going stronger than
ever.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Motley Reflection.</span>&mdash;What
better name for an historian
than &quot;<span class="smcap">Motley</span>&quot;? Not
in the buffoonic sense of the
term; not when, to change
the spelling, &quot;Motley is your
only <i>ware</i>&quot;; but as implying
a variety of talents as
equal as the patches in the
perfect dress of a harlequin.
Of course the pen is the wand.
What transformations cannot
the Motley historian bring
about! A monster becomes a
man, and a man a monster.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. Earwaker.</i> Yes, dear Lady <span class="smcap">Lullington</span>, I&#39;ve always
insisted on each of my girls adopting a distinct line of her own,
and the result has been <i>most</i> satisfactory. <span class="smcap">Louisa</span>, my eldest, is
literary; she had a little story accepted not long ago by <i>The Milky
Way</i>; then <span class="smcap">Maria</span> is musical; practises regularly three hours every
day on her violin. <span class="smcap">Fanny</span> has become quite an expert in photography&mdash;kodaked
her father the other day in the act of trying a
difficult stroke at billiards; a back view&mdash;but <i>so</i> clever and characteristic!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Lullington (absently).</i> A back view? How <i>nice</i>!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. Earw.</i> He was the only one of the family who didn&#39;t recognise
it at once. Then my youngest, <span class="smcap">Caroline</span>&mdash;well, I must say
that for a long time I was quite in despair about <span class="smcap">Caroline</span>. It
really looked as if there was no single
thing that she had the slightest bent
or inclination for. So at last I thought
she had better take up Religion, and
make <i>that</i> her speciality.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Lull. (languidly).</i> Religion!
How <i>very</i> nice!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. Earw.</i> Well, I got her a <i>Christian
Year</i> and a covered basket, and
quantities of tracts, and so on; but,
somehow, she didn&#39;t seem to get <i>on</i> with
it. So I let her give it up; and now
she&#39;s gone in for poker-etching instead.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Lull. (by an act of unconscious
cerebration).</i> Poker-etching! How very
<i>very</i> nice!</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Her eyelids close gently.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> Oh, but indeed, Lady
<span class="smcap">Culverin</span>, I thought he was perfectly
charmin&#39;; not a bit booky, you know,
but as clever as he can stick; knows
more about terriers than any man I ever
met!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Culverin.</i> So glad you found
him agreeable, my dear. I was half
afraid he might strike you as&mdash;well, just
a little bit <i>common</i> in his way of talking.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> Pr&#39;aps&mdash;but, after all,
one can&#39;t expect those sort of people to
talk quite like we do ourselves, <i>can</i> one?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Is that Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>
you are finding fault with, <span class="smcap">Albinia</span>?
It is curious that <i>you</i> should be the
one person here who&mdash;&mdash;<i>I</i> consider
him a very worthy and talented young
man, and I shall most certainly ask him
to dinner&mdash;or <i>lunch</i>, at all events&mdash;as
soon as we return. I daresay Lady
<span class="smcap">Rhoda</span> will not object to come and meet
him.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> Rather not. <i>I</i>&#39;ll come,
like a shot!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Culv. (to herself).</i> I suppose
it&#39;s very silly of me to be so prejudiced.
Nobody else seems to mind him!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Miss Spelwane (crossing over to them).</i>
Oh, Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span>, Lady <span class="smcap">Lullington</span> has such a <i>delightful</i> idea&mdash;she&#39;s
just been saying how very very nice it would be if Mr.
<span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> could be persuaded to read some of his poetry aloud to us
presently. <i>Do</i> you think it could be managed?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Culv. (in distress).</i> Really, my dear <span class="smcap">Vivien</span>, I&mdash;I don&#39;t know
<i>what</i> to say. I fancy people would so <i>much</i> rather talk&mdash;don&#39;t you
think so, <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span>?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant.</i> Probably they would, <span class="smcap">Albinia</span>. It is most unlikely
that they would care to hear anything more intellectual and
instructive than the sound of their own voices.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Miss Spelw.</i> I <i>told</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Lullington</span> that I was afraid you would
think it a bore, Lady <span class="smcap">Cantire</span>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant.</i> You are perfectly mistaken, Miss <span class="smcap">Spelwane</span>. I
flatter myself I am quite as capable of appreciating a literary
privilege as anybody here. But I cannot answer for its being
acceptable to the majority.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Culv.</i> No, it wouldn&#39;t do at all. And it would be making
this young man so <i>much</i> too conspicuous.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant.</i> You are talking nonsense, my dear. When you are
fortunate enough to secure a celebrity at Wyvern, you can&#39;t make
him <i>too</i> conspicuous. I never knew that <span class="smcap">Laura Lullington</span> had
any taste for literature before, but there&#39;s something to be said for
her suggestion&mdash;if it can be carried out; it would at least provide
a welcome relief from the usual after-dinner dullness of this sort of
gathering.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Miss Spelw.</i> Then&mdash;would <i>you</i> ask him, Lady <span class="smcap">Cantire</span>?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant.</i> I, my dear? You forget that <i>I</i> am not hostess here.
My sister-in-law is the proper person to do that.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Culv.</i> Indeed I couldn&#39;t. But perhaps, <span class="smcap">Vivien</span>, if you liked
to suggest it to him, he might&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Miss Spelw.</i> I&#39;ll try, dear Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span>. And if my poor
little persuasions have no effect, I shall fall back on Lady <span class="smcap">Cantire</span>,
and then he <i>can&#39;t</i> refuse. I must go and tell dear Lady <span class="smcap">Lullington</span>&mdash;she&#39;ll
be so pleased! (<i>To herself, as she skims away.</i>) I
generally <i>do</i> get my own way. But I mean him to do it to please <i>Me</i>!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. Chatteris</i> (<i>a little later, to</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>). Have you heard what
a treat is in store for us? That delightful Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> is going to
give us a reading or a recitation, or something, from his own poems;
at least, Miss <span class="smcap">Spelwane</span> is to ask him as soon as the men come in.
Only <i>I</i> should have thought that he would be much more likely to
consent if <i>you</i> asked him.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Would you? I&#39;m sure
I don&#39;t know why.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. Chatt. (archly).</i> Oh, he took me
in to dinner, you know, and it&#39;s quite
wonderful how people confide in me,
but I suppose they feel I can be trusted.
He mentioned a little fact, which gave
me the impression that a certain fair
lady&#39;s wishes would be supreme with
him.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie (to herself).</i> The wretch!
He <i>has</i> been boasting of my unfortunate
letter! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> had
no business to give you any impression
of the kind. And the mere fact that
I&mdash;that I happened to admire his
verses&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. Chatt.</i> Exactly! Poets&#39; heads
are so easily turned; and, as I said to
Captain <span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Captain <span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span>!
You have been talking about it&mdash;to <i>him</i>!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. Chatt.</i> I&#39;d no idea you would
mind anybody knowing, or I would
never have dreamed of&mdash;&mdash;I&#39;ve such
a perfect <i>horror</i> of gossip! It took me
so much by surprise, that I simply
couldn&#39;t resist; but I can easily tell
Captain <span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span> it was all a mistake;
<i>he</i> knows how fearfully inaccurate I
always am.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie.</i> I would rather you
said nothing more about it, please; it is
really not worth while contradicting
anything so utterly absurd. (<i>To herself.</i>)
That <span class="smcap">Gerald</span>&mdash;Captain <span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span>&mdash;of
all people, should know of my
letter! And goodness only knows what
story she may have made out of it!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. Chatt. (to herself, as she moves
away).</i> I&#39;ve been letting my tongue run
away with me, as usual. She&#39;s <i>not</i> the
original of &quot;Lady Grisoline,&quot; after all.
Perhaps he meant <span class="smcap">Vivien Spelwane</span>&mdash;the
description was much more like <i>her</i>!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Pilliner</i> (<i>who has just entered with some of the younger men, to</i>

we all to sit in a circle, like <span class="smcap">Moore</span> and <span class="smcap">Burgess</span> people? You&#39;re
<i>not</i> going to set the poor dear Bishop down to play baby-games?
How perfectly barbarous of you!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Miss Spelw.</i> The chairs are being arranged for something much
more intellectual. We are going to get Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> to read a
poem to us, if you want to know. I <i>told</i> you I should manage it.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Pill.</i> There&#39;s only one drawback to that highly desirable arrangement.
The bard, with prophetic foreknowledge of your designs, has
unostentatiously retired to roost. So I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll have to do
without your poetry this evening&mdash;that is, unless you care to avail
yourself again of my services?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Miss Spelw. (indignantly).</i> It is too <i>mean</i> of you. You must have
told him!</p>

<p class="right">[<i>He protests his innocence.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> <span class="smcap">Archie</span>, what&#39;s become of Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>? I particularly
want to ask him something.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Bearpark.</i> The poet? He nipped upstairs&mdash;as I told you all along
he meant to&mdash;to scribble some of his democratic drivel, and (<i>with a

<p class="indent"><i>Captain Thicknesse (to himself, as he enters).</i> She&#39;s keepin&#39; a chair

chap?... (<i>He meets</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie&#39;s</span> <i>eye suddenly.</i>) Great Scott! If
she means it for <i>me</i>!... I&#39;ve half a mind not to&mdash;&mdash;No, I shall be a
fool if I lose such a chance! (<i>He crosses, and drops into the vacant
chair next hers.</i>) I <i>may</i> sit here, mayn&#39;t I?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>simply</i>). I meant you to. We used to be such good
friends; it&#39;s a pity to have misunderstandings. And&mdash;and I want
to ask you what that silly little Mrs. <span class="smcap">Chatteris</span> has been telling you
at dinner about me.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Capt. Thick.</i> Well, she was sayin&#39;&mdash;and I must say I don&#39;t understand
it, after your tellin&#39; me you knew nothing about this Mr.
<span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> till this afternoon&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie.</i> But I don&#39;t. And I&mdash;I <i>did</i> offer to explain, but you
said you weren&#39;t curious!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Capt. Thick.</i> Didn&#39;t want you to tell me anything that perhaps
you&#39;d rather not, don&#39;t you know. Still, I <i>should</i> like to know how
this poet chap came to write a poem all about you, and call it &quot;Lady
Grisoline.&quot; if he never&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie.</i> But it&#39;s too ridiculous! How <i>could</i> he? When he
never saw me, that I know of, in all his life before!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Capt. Thick.</i> He told Mrs. <span class="smcap">Chatteris</span> you were the original of
his &quot;Lady Grisoline&quot; anyway, and really&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie.</i> He dared to tell her that? How disgracefully
impertinent of him. (<i>To herself.</i>) So long as he hasn&#39;t talked about
my letter, he may say what he pleases!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Capt. Thick.</i> But what <i>was</i> it you were goin&#39; to explain to me?
You said there was somethin&#39;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). It&#39;s no use; I&#39;d sooner die than tell him
about that letter now! (<i>Aloud.</i>) I&mdash;I only wished you to understand
that, whatever I think about poetry&mdash;I detest poets!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant.</i> Yes, as you say, Bishop, a truly Augustan mode of
recreation. Still, Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> doesn&#39;t seem to have come in yet, so

<h2>THE BLUE GARDENIA.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>A Colourable Imitation.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent">It was a splendid scarlet afternoon, and the little garden looked
its gayest in the midsummer sunshine which streamed down its tiny
paths. Yellow asters grew golden in the pale lemon light, whilst
the green carnations which abounded everywhere seemed so natural
that it was difficult to believe they had been
wired on to the plants that morning by a
London firm of florists. That was a plan on
which <span class="smcap">Cecil Paragraph</span> always insisted. As
he was so fond of saying, Nature was a dear
old thing, but she lacked inventiveness. It
was only an outworn convention which objected
to gilding the lily, or colouring the
carnation. So the London florists always came
each morning to convert the garden into a
pink rhapsody.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:25%;">

</div>

<p class="indent">Lord <span class="smcap">Archie</span> (he was not a Lord really, but
<span class="smcap">Cecil</span> always insisted that a title was a
matter of temperament) and <span class="smcap">Cecil</span> were sitting out on the lawn.
Clever conversation always takes place on the lawn. <span class="smcap">Cecil</span> and
Lord <span class="smcap">Archie</span> smoked high-priced cigarettes. The witty characters
always do.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear <span class="smcap">Archie</span>,&quot; said <span class="smcap">Cecil</span>, &quot;I have something important to
tell you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you were not <span class="smcap">Cecil Paragraph</span>, that would mean that the
milkman had called to have his account paid, or that <span class="smcap">Mary</span>&mdash;or is it
<span class="smcap">Martha</span>?&mdash;had given notice. It&#39;s like letters headed &#39;Important,&#39;&mdash;a
prospectus of a gold mine, or a letter from a distant relative to say
he&#39;s coming to stay the week-end. Saying &#39;week-end&#39; always reminds
me of the <span class="smcap">Baron de Book-Worms</span>. I fancy myself haggling
for a cheap ticket at a booking-office.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Archie</span>, you&#39;ve prattled enough. Remember it is I who am
expected to fill the bill. <span class="smcap">Archie</span>, I am writing a book.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A book? You will let me collaborate with you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Collaboration is the modern method of evading responsibility.
A genius moves in a cycle of masterpieces, but it is never a cycle
made for two. It reminds me of the book by Mr. <span class="smcap">Rider Haggard</span>
and Mr. <span class="smcap">Lang</span>. Too late Mr. <span class="smcap">Haggard</span> found that he had killed the
goose which laid the golden eggs. He had lost the notices which his
collaborator could no longer write.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it is so much trouble to write a book. Would not a purple
newspaper article effect your purpose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One would think I was Mr. <span class="smcap">Athelstan Riley</span>, or the Independent
Labour Party, to hear you talk of effecting my purpose. But
in any case the book&#39;s the thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me, <span class="smcap">Cecil</span>, tell me about your book,&quot; said Lord <span class="smcap">Archie</span>,
with the ardour of a disciple of <span class="smcap">Cecil&#39;s</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will be called <i>The Blue Gardenia</i>. The title is one of the
unemployed; it has nothing to do with the
story.&quot;</p>

<h2>A PIER OF THE EMPIRE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By a Commoner of the Nation.</i>)</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:20%;">
<a href="images/189.png"><img width="100%" src="images/189.png" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p class="indent">As licensing day was approaching, I thought it my duty to visit the
Empire Theatre of Varieties in Leicester Square, so that if needs be I
could appear as a witness either for the prosecution or the defence.
I am happy to say that my expedition has put me in a position to join
the garrison. From first to last&mdash;from item No. 1 to item No. 10&mdash;the
entertainments at the Empire are excellent. And in the
general praise I am able to include &quot;Living
Pictures,&quot; which are all that even an
archbishop could wish that they should be.
But the chief attraction of the evening is
a new <i>ballet divertissement</i> in one tableau,
called <i>On Brighton Pier</i>, which has
evidently been put up to teach the members
of the L. C. C. how much better things are
done in the Sussex watering place than in
the great metropolis. According to &quot;the
Argument,&quot; when the scene opens, people
are promenading in the sun, and &quot;some
gentlemen bribe the bath chairmen to give
up their places in the evening so that they
may flirt with the girls accompanying the
invalids.&quot; But possibly as an afterthought
this was thought a little too strong for the
Censor of Spring Gardens. I found the
&quot;gentlemen&quot; (most of them in high white
hats), and then I discovered the bath chairmen,
but there was nothing to lead me to
believe that the connecting links between
the two were bribery and corruption. In
addition to this <i>plat à la Don Giovanni</i> there were an <i>entrée</i> in the
shape of a gathering of schoolboys and schoolgirls, a <i>soufflé</i> in some
military plus naval drill, and a <i>pièce de résistance</i> in a change of
scene from the deck of the Pier to the depths of the sea beneath it.
And here let me say that I use <i>résistance</i> in a purely culinary sense,
as nothing could have worked more smoothly than the transformation.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:20%;">
<a href="images/189a.png"><img width="100%" src="images/189a.png" alt="" /></a>
<p class="center">&quot;I can conscientiously
recommend it.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Madame <span class="smcap">Katti Lanner</span>, by whom the ballet has been invented, is
a past mistress in the art of concocting terpsichorean trifles, and never
admits any difficulty in combining the poetry of fancy with the
actuality of fact. In her latest production she finds that after a while
a change of scene is necessary. The public, after admiring the refreshment
stalls and the distant view of the Grand Hotel, want something
more. Certainly, why not? The daughter of an American
millionaire, who has met a rather effeminate gentleman for the first
time, overcome by the heat, falls asleep. Then, to quote from &quot;the
Argument,&quot; in her dream she sees sirens and sea-nymphs, led by the
<i>Queen Coralie</i> (Signorina <span class="smcap">Bice Porro</span>), unsuccessfully attempt to lure
away her lover, but&mdash;awaking from her sleep&mdash;the vision disappears,
and she finds him at her feet. All this was very pretty, and the
scruples of the L. C. C. were considered by the lack of success of
<i>Queen Coralie</i> to shake the swain&#39;s fidelity to his betrothed.
Although evidently interested in the dances of the sirens and sea-nymphs&mdash;in
spite of their treating him with little or no attention&mdash;he
was <i>ultra</i> discreet in making the acquaintance of her submarine
majesty. When the Queen stood on one toe he merely accepted her
invitation to hold her hand, and thus enable her to revolve on the
tip of her right toe&mdash;but went no further. And really and truly, as
a gentleman, it was impossible for him to do less. At any rate his
conduct was so unexceptional in <i>Grace Dollar&#39;s</i> dream, that his
<i>fiancée</i>, who, according to &quot;the Argument,&quot; had had &quot;a slight
quarrel with him,&quot; immediately sought reconciliation. Besides the
submarine interlude, <i>On Brighton Pier</i> has a serious underplot.
<i>Senora Dolares</i> (Signorina <span class="smcap">Cavallazzi</span>), who has been searching all
over the world for her daughter, who had been stolen from her ten
years ago, is personally conducted to the pleasant promenade off the
beach. Husband and wife seemingly spend
the entire day on the Pier. They are here
in the morning, in the sunshine, and here
when the variegated lamps are lighted at
night. The Senora is pleased at nothing.
She regards the vagaries of a negro comedian
with indifference, and does not even smile at
the gambols of a clown dog. Suddenly a
girl called <i>Dora</i> appears. And now once
more to quote the Argument. &quot;<i>Dora</i> plays
upon her mandoline some melody the <i>Senora
Dolares</i> recognises. She quickly asks the
girl where she first heard it; and <i>Dora</i> says
that a lady used to sing it to her in her
early days and that the same lady gave her
a cross, which she produces. The Senora, by
means of the cross, recognises in <i>Dora</i> her long-lost child. Amid
great excitement she leads her tenderly away [in the direction of the
Hotel Metropole], and, after some further dances, the curtain falls.&quot;
Nothing can be prettier, and more truly moral, than <i>On Brighton
Pier</i>. I can conscientiously recommend it to every member of
the L. C. C.; some will smile at the eccentric dance of <i>Major
Spooner</i> (Mr. <span class="smcap">Will Bishop</span>); others will grin at the more boisterous
humour of <i>Christopher Dollar</i> (Mr. <span class="smcap">John Ridley</span>); and all must
weep at the depressed velvet coat of <i>Don Diego</i> (Mr. <span class="smcap">George
Ashton</span>), the husband of <i>Senora Dolares</i>, in search of a (comparatively)
long-lost daughter. Judging from the reception the ballet
received the other evening, I fancy that <i>On Brighton Pier</i> will
remain on London boards for any length of time.</p>

<p class="indent">
[&quot;<span class="smcap">Autolycus</span>,&quot; in the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> of October 11, inveighs against
the necessity of conversation between friends:&mdash;&quot;If I find a girl nice to look

<p class="indent">&quot;?&quot; I asked with my right eyebrow,
rousing myself from a fit of abstraction.</p>

<p class="indent">She pointed at a young man who had just
strolled past our seats in the Row without
noticing her. He was dressed in the height
of fashion, and was accompanied by a lady
in very smart attire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;...&quot; explained <span class="smcap">Nelly</span>, with her mouth

<p class="center">&quot;Taught him to smoke.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">I looked at her, and gathered by a swift
process of intuition that she had <i>made</i> that
boy, and taught him to drink and smoke&mdash;of
course, in moderation; had got his hair
cut, and had rescued him from an adventuress.
From her he had learnt not to go to Monday Pops, nor to
carry things about in brown paper&mdash;in fact, he owed everything to
her.... And now&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;§&quot; I visibly commented, not knowing for the moment how else
to express myself. In fact I was getting just a trifle out of my
depth. However, I gazed again at her.... Yes, she had deeply
eloquent blue eyes, fringed with dark eyelashes, that voiced forth
every emotion! Stay, I am afraid that in my admiration my speechless
remarks had wandered from the topic of our mute discussion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#8224;&quot; interjected her pitying but impatient glance, telling me that
my devotion was useless.</p>

<p class="indent">I looked very miserable. It is generally understood that I am the
most miserable of men since Miss <span class="smcap">Eaton&#39;s</span> engagement to an American
millionaire.</p>

<p class="indent">[Here I am sorry to say that our dialogue becomes somewhat elliptical,
owing to the difficulty of finding enough unappropriated
printers&#39; symbols to represent our different shades of silence. However,
with luck, I may be able to scrape together a few more, and
come to some sort of conclusion.]</p>

<p class="indent">Let me see&mdash;where were we?... Oh, on the subject of the
boy and his companion, who, it seems, were engaged.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;* * *&quot; resumed <span class="smcap">Nelly</span>, in a look which spoke three volumes. I
divined at once that she had thrown him over, that there had been
an awful scene, and his mother had written a horrid letter, that he
had come back and abjectly apologised, that he said she had destroyed
his faith in women (the usual thing), that he
went on sending letters for a whole year: in
fact, that it made her quite uncomfortable....
Really, <span class="smcap">Nelly</span> can give points to <span class="smcap">Lord

<p class="indent">&quot;?&quot; inquired my right eye, meaning, had

<p class="indent">Miss <span class="smcap">Nelly</span> prodded the path with her
parasol.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;¿&quot; I asked again, referring to a different
person, and, I am afraid, squinting.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss <span class="smcap">Nelly</span> looked for the fraction of an

<h2>VENETIAN FLOWER SELLERS</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Young, dark-eyed beauties, graceful, gay,</p>
<p class="i2">So I expected you to be,</p>
<p>Adorning in a charming way</p>
<p class="i2">This silent City of the Sea.</p>
<p>But you are very far from that;</p>

<p>Why should you, flower-sellers, then,</p>
<p class="i2">Be so advanced in age and size?</p>
<p>You cannot charm the foreign men,</p>

<p>I&#39;d buy them, just to have a chat,</p>

<p>Oh go away! I hate the sight</p>

<h2>FIRST IMPRESSIONS.</h2>

<p class="indent">There is no doubt that one&#39;s first impressions
are always the brightest and the best;
therefore I resolve to record the first impressions
of a first visit to the Italian lakes.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>British Bellagio.</i>&mdash;&quot;Hôtel Victoria, Prince
de Galles et des Iles Britanniques,&quot; or some
such name, is usually, as <i>Baedeker</i> says,
&quot;frequented by the English.&quot; They are here
certainly, and one hears one&#39;s native language
everywhere. There are the honeymoon
couples,
silent and reserved,
who glare
fiercely at anyone
who might be
supposed to imagine
for a moment
that they
are newly married;
there are
people who converse
in low monotonous
voices
about the weather,
which
changes every
hour; there is an
old lady, who
gives one startling information, telling one,
for instance, that <span class="smcap">Paul Veronese</span> was born
at Verona; and there are two or three British
menservants, gazing with superb disdain at
the poor foreigners. The hotel is very quiet.
The evening of a week-day is like Sunday
evening, and Sunday evening is&mdash;&mdash;!!! If
only the weather were not also English, or
even worse. On the last day of September
the only warm place is by the fire in the
<i>fumoir</i>. So let us hurry off from this wintry
climate to somewhere, to anywhere. By the
first boat we go.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:30%;">
<a href="images/192.png"><img width="100%" src="images/192.png" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p class="indent">Still English everywhere. At Bellagio a
great crowd, and heaps of luggage. At
Cadenabbia a greater crowd, and more heaps
of luggage. Here they come, struggling
along the gangway in the wind. There is a
sad-faced Englishman, his hands full of
packages, his pockets stuffed with others,
carrying under his arm a little old picture
wrapped loosely in pink tissue paper, which
the wind blows here and there. He is a forgetful
man, for he wanders to and fro collecting
his possessions. With him is another
forgetful Englishman in very shabby clothes,
who also carries packages in paper, and who
drags after him an immensely fat bull-dog at
the end of a cord five yards long, which
winds round posts and human legs and other
obstacles. At last they are all on board&mdash;the
forgetful Englishmen have darted back for
the last time to fetch in an ice-axe and an
old umbrella&mdash;and on we go over the grey
water, past the grey hills, under the grey
sky, towards Como. At Cernobbio the shabby
Englishman lands, dragging his bull-dog at
the end of the cord, and carrying in his
arms two rolls of rugs, a bag, and other
trifles. His sad-faced companion, still holding
his tiny Old Master in the ever-diminishing
pink paper, wanders in and out seeking
forgotten treasures, an ice-axe, a bag, another
paper parcel. Finally all are landed; the
gangway is withdrawn, the steamer begins to
move. Suddenly there is a shout. The shabby
Englishman has forgotten something. The
sympathetic passengers look round. There is
a solitary umbrella on a seat. No doubt
that is his. A friendly stranger cries, &quot;Is
this yours?&quot; and tosses it to him on the
quay. Then there is another shout. &quot;<i>Ach
Himmel</i>, dat is mine!&quot; The frantic German
waves his arms, the umbrella is tossed back,
he catches it and is happy. But meanwhile
another English man, the most egregious ass
that ever lived, has discovered yet another
solitary umbrella, which he casts wildly into
space. For one moment the captain, the passengers,
the people on the quay, gaze breathless
as it whirls through the air. It falls
just short of the landing-stage, and sinks into
the grey waters of that chilly lake, never
more to be recovered, in any sense of the
word. In those immeasurable depths its neat
silk covering will decay, its slender frame
will fall to pieces. It has gone for ever. Beneath
this grey Italian sky some Italian gamp
must keep off these Italian showers. Then the
captain, the passengers, and the people smile
and laugh. I, who write this, am the only
one on whose face there is not a grin, for
that umbrella was mine.</p>

<p class="indent">&#39;Tis November makes the (Lord) Mayor
to go. As the ninth approaches, the year&#39;s
tenant of the Mansion House packs up and
says farewell to all his greatness. On the
principle that attributes happiness to a country
that has no annals, the outgoing <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span>
is to be congratulated on his year of office. It
is probable that out of aldermanic circles not
one man of a hundred in the street could
straight off say what is his Lordship&#39;s name.
<i>Mr. Punch</i>, who knows most things, only
ventures to believe that the good alderman is
known in the family circle as Sir <span class="smcap">Edward
Tyler</span>. And a very good name, too. In the
occult ceremonies pertaining to freemasonry
it is understood there is an official known as
the Tiler, whose duty is to guard the door,
strictly excluding all but those whose right
of entrance is peremptory. Our Sir <span class="smcap">Edward</span>

interested in observing the effect in actual
work of ships and guns identical with our
own. It is a sort of gigantic test got up for
our benefit at somebody else&#39;s expense. That
an ancient empire seems tottering to a fall

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
